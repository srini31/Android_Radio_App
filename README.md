# Android_Radio_App
An App to stream music from YouTube or a Web server

A lot of Audio and Video files are available from an organization. An App will be designed in Android to stream audio/video files from YouTube. Similar to Pandora, music can be heard even if the App is moved to the background.

Features: Bookmarks (pre-created and user-created), playlists, pictures, announcements, email links, repeat an audio 'n' number of times, 
All users are not technically proficient, so user friendly features need to be built in.
This will save storage and organization issues for a large group of users who currently save files on their phones.

Will make it easy to announce and distribute content
The links are in chat applications and emails currently and are not organized
Bookmarks will make it easy to find content, whereas now navigating YouTube takes too much time as the UI is not optimized for this task.

App will have a some play lists that are pre-sorted and organized.
Will need a search option to search/query on YouTube, get the list, sort and display in the App. This link should be played in the App and must have an option to bookmark in the App. Alternately, a link from YouTube can be copied and added as a bookmark inside the App.
Will have a View on YouTube link for videos

===================================================
Plan of Action
--------------
Research if any such app already exists and if it will be a good fit, look at terms and conditions, etc

Any existing App will not provide administrative control
Start with a minimum viable product mockup, get estimates of time, resouces required
present mock up to users, get feedback

Decide on Go/ No Go with development
Develop and iterate for some cycles
Release version 1
